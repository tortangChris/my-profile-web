                I am currently studying at Pamantasan ng Cabuyao for my college degree. Before this, I completed high school at AMA Computer College Calamba, having started my journey at Pulo National High School. I began my education at San Isidro Elementary School.

                Alongside my studies, I gained work experience as a Game Attendant at Enchanted Kingdom, where I interacted with guests to ensure they had fun playing the games. I also worked as a Production Worker at SPI Corporation.
